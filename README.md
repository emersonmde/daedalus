# DaedalusOS

DaedalusOS is my personal playground for learning low-level Rust by bringing up a tiny kernel on the Raspberry Pi 4. I’m porting ideas I like from Philipp Oppermann’s blog and other hobby kernels, but the project exists purely so I can experiment, break things, and understand how the hardware works.
