# Override the workspace default target for dev server
# Dev server runs on the host (macOS/Linux), not on the Pi
# So we need to use the host's native target with std library, not aarch64-daedalus

[build]
# Explicitly set host target to override workspace aarch64-daedalus
target = "aarch64-apple-darwin"
target-dir = "../target/dev-server"
